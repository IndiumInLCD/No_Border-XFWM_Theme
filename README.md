## Installation

1. sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/themes/empty/xfwm4
   - You can replace "empty" with whatever name you want. This name will be the name of your theme.
2. sudo touch /usr/share/themes/empty/xfwm4/themerc
   - Leave this file blank and your done.
3. Finished!!
   - Open up your window manager settings and choose your newly created theme.

_Someone told me that you can create this no-border theme for other window managers such as mate, cinnamon & openbox etc. You apparently just need to change the name of xfwm4 to your choosen desktop environment. I have not tested this out as of yet but I don't see why it shouldn't work._
